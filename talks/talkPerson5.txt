1-Who could you be? No matter what, will you play with me?
1-Oh, I haven't said what... whoever rolls higher number, wins a key!
if player "rolled" lower:
2-Hahahaa today is my lucky day... I get to keep the key for now
2-But I'm willing to give u another chance, of course I am...
2-I am this good, so take the chance while it lasts...
if player "rolled" higher:
3-My... I have lost yet again... Oh, yes here is your key as promised
if talked to after:
4-I have nothing that would be of any value to anyone...
4-I know you want to escape, and so, I have nothing for you...
