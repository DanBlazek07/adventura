1-Hmm... Yes, I do have a key, and I don't know what to do with it...
1-You may have it, make good use of it please...
next talk:
2-... I don't have all the keys *haha* you have to ask others too...
2-I think it may help, if you want to get out, but do you want to get out?
2-I mean, is that really what you wish to do? Think about it at least...
2-I don't know if you know, but for example I stayed here...
2-Anyway, I won't force you into anything, of course... Just so you know...
2-Alright, I won't distract you from leaving anymore... See you!
