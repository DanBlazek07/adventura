As you jump out of the window, something in you had moved.
You remembered everything, out of thin air.
Your name, your title, everything. But something is missing...
How did you get here, this memory is completely blank.
You realize this place belongs to you, so you cant just leave it.
But why were you there? Who put you there? For what reason?
Those questions are left unanswered, as you fall down.
You, now knowing the area, go back to where you lived.
Slowton, name of the village. Its a beautiful piece of land in your realm.
The locals may seem nice at first, but they are as rotten as a flesh of a zombie.
This is why you immediately thought that they had put you in there.
But what was so bad for them to put you there in the first place?
Who did you piss off to do this to you? Well, they only locked you...
They wanted you to one day get out? But then why put you there then?
It doesnt make any sense. Not at all. But I suppose you dont care.
You are happy that you got out, after all... To go back home.
Enjoy the good time while it lasts. It wont be long... You know it.
You are used to it this way, and you admit that you like it.
