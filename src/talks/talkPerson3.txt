1-Hello hello, the one and only key for some room is right here!
1-Oh, you want it? No way I'm giving it to some random stranger!
1-I did that in the past, and what, he hasn't left either way...
1-I will tell you what, I will give you this key, but you go and talk with him
after talking with P4:
2-What? he LOST the key? in that case... I suppose I will give it you, as promised...
2-I believe you won't lose it... You better not...
after using key:
3-Well, that's what I like to hear! I didn't know if the key had a use...
3-Now that this is done, how about escaping? I will gladly go out with you, if you get out...
