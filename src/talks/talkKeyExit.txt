You have used the golden key, and you felt good whilst doing it.
There is one thing around you that you see - mountains.
You remembered that you have gone through them in the past.
Where does the thought come from, that you don't know.
There is a path, you decided to follow it.
There, you remember the path to somewhere. But where?
As hard as you try to remember it, you don't know anything.
You went into the village by the name Slowton. You remember being there.
You remembered the date 30.2.99999, but when was it? Or was it?
The village looked nice so you decided to stay there.
Maybe you will figure out who you are when you are there?
Who knows, you have to figure that out... Or you can also just not.
Not know who you used to be, but know that some people may know you...
After all, who needs to know if they were a bad guy, no?
The time to know more, will come eventually... But it's not the time yet.
You will not know who you are, or used to be, unless you ask.
But you just came to a village not knowing anyone, they wouldn't tell you anything quite yet...
The locals seemed nice at first, but... are they as they seem?
